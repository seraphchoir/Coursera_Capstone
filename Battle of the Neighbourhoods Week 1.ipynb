    "2020 was a remarkable year that saw the introduction of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. COVID-19, a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, caused flu-like and pneumonia-like symptoms, with more severe cases requiring hospitalization and in the worst case causing death. The mortality of the disease appeared to be correlated with the age and other comorbidity factors of the infected patient, such as diabetes and obesity. The virus was thought to have originated from Wuhan, China and had quickly spread across the world, with some countries such as USA, Italy, and Spain exceeding the case count within China. The high case count had quickly overwhelmed the hospitals of these countries, causing the mortality of the disease to rise sharply as vulnerable patients were unable to receive adequate treatment from the overwhelmed hospitals and died. Many nations across the world have implemented drastic population control measures to restrict movement and public gatherings, including quarantines and lockdowns, in a bid to slow the spread of the virus and alleviate the number of cases their hospitals would encounter at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of March 30, 2020, COVID-19 is present within Toronto, Canada, and case counts, including severe cases, have been steadily rising. Hospitals in Toronto are at risk of being overwhelmed by the steadily increasing case counts, especially severe cases requiring hospitalization. This project investigates what would be an ideal site for a temporary COVID-19 hospital in Toronto in anticipation of the expected surge of severe cases requiring hospitalization. The temporary hospital would be expected to be similar to the <a href=\"https://qz.com/1792705/coronavirus-the-engineering-behind-wuhans-rapidly-built-hospitals/\">Huoshenshan Hospital or Leishenshan Hospital</a> used in Wuhan. The analysis will include the selection of a site within Toronto that can best accommodate the highest concentration of total potential severe cases of COVID-19 that would require hospitalization in intensive care not already served by Toronto's current hospital infrastructure. Other considerations, such as build timeline, cost, political response, and other feasibility-related issues, are not in scope of this report. "
